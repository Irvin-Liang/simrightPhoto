#### Please make sure node.js and mongoDB are installed properly in your system.

## How to run:
1. Install dependencies, in root directory, run ```npm install```
2. Start mongoDB daemon, ```mongod --dbpath [PATH]``` where PATH is the directory you want to store database data, normally we use ```/db ```. Make sure port 27017 is available when you run the command.
3. Start the server, in root directory, run ```npm start```. Make sure port 3000 is available before running the command.
